Project Restructuring Plan:

1. Create frontend/ folder
2. Move these frontend files into frontend/:
   - index.html
   - home.html
   - dashboard.html
   - devices.html
   - analytics.html
   - settings.html
   - css/ (with styles.css)
   - js/ (with script.js, analytics.js)
3. Create backend/ folder
4. Move these backend files into backend/:
   - server.js
   - package.json
   - package-lock.json
5. After moving files, review and update paths or references in backend/server.js or any others if needed.
6. Test project by running backend server and opening frontend files.

Please confirm if I can proceed with this plan.
